# ReleaseNotesGenerator
Uses a list of issues and creates release notes from them.

This program is built on TypeScript.

Before starting, you will need to generate a token from Jira.  Instructions can be found here: [Jira Token Instructions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html).  These will need to be placed in `config/keys.json`.
